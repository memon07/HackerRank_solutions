From the given array eg = [4,4,1,3] we have to print the total number of occurence of the highest number
<br/>here it is 4.<br/>
4 is been seen twice in the array therefore we print 2.

```javascript
let max = Math.max(...ar);
```

here we pass array as in javascript in build function max to find the largest number

### note
Do read the difference between spread and destructuring
