The question asks us to find the max sum and the min sum of the elements in an array.

We will follow a simple logical approach for solving this.

If we will find the min and the max element from the array 

```javascript
var min = Math.min(...arr);
var max = Math.max(...arr);
```

Here we use javascript's in-build functions min and max while passing the array as its arguments (destructuring method of es6)
